## Graduation

![Degree Image](/images/blog/graduation.jpg)

If I had to do it all over again, I would. That is the first thing that came to mind when I looked back on my university
experience. I definitely had my ups and downs, and having to sacrifice grades in some classes for other priorities weren't
ideal, but overall I really enjoyed my experiences at university. Now, I just want to take the time here to thank my
entire family and all my friends who I met along the way! It was with everyone's help that I could learn so much in this short time.

Lastly, a few words I'd like to keep with me past my undergraduate career:

- Keep on learning: I'd like to always be learning, to always be a student, and to always be open to new ideas
- Work with others: I'd like to meet many more people, share more memories, and to learn from the experiences of others
- Manage time, don't waste it: I realized that there's always never enough time. The important point is to do what matters most, and to set aside time to do them. There truly never is enough time.

That's all!

Thanks UBC! Thanks UBC PHAS! Thanks UBC Computer Science! And thanks UBC Co-op for getting me that foot in the software industry!

Till next time :)
