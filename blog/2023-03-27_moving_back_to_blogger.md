# Moving back to blogger

I've been really slacking on maintaining my website these days. Writing in markdown is proving to be both a difficult task and time-consuming at the same time. What started out as me thinking that I would be able to do the entire CMS myself has now turned into a minor overhead everytime I want to make a blog post but not make it something really big.

I also recently dug up my old blogger blog which my Mom encouraged me to start back when I was still a elementary school kid. I'd like to continue with that blog, just posting about anything really. So I'm just going to drop a link here for anyone that wants to follow my blog, and say goodbye on my website for now.

See you all there (hopefully)!

Omar
