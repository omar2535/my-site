# CPSC310

I took the course *CPSC310 introduction to software engineering* from 2020-January to 2020-April. The course was taught by Elisa Baniassad and was mostly about how software engineering works in industry.

The course consisted of a web project, 1 midterm and 1 final exam. The web-based project took up the most time with two week sprints and checkpoints that depended on how well the previous checkpoints were implemented.
