# PHYS 216

These are my course notes for PHYS216 that I took with professor Ludovic Van Waerbeke. The course was taught well and the content delivered effectively.

The course format consisted of three 1 hour lectures and a one hour tutorial every week. The lectures covered the theoretical material along with doing some sample problems while the tutorials consisted of practice problems that were given feedback on by the teaching assistants.
