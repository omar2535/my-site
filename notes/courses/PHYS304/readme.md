# PHYS304

These are notes for the course *PHYS 304 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics* which I took with Dr. Eric Zhitnitsky. 

Overall I had a enjoyable time with the course and the workload was fair for the content in the course. The course consisted of weekly assignments with questions from the book *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics* by David J. Griffiths along with 2 midterms and 1 final exam.
