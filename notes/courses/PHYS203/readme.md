# PHYS203

Notes for the course **Thermal Physics I** I took at UBC with Dr. Joanna Karczmarek. The course consisted of 3 tests and 1 final exam. The final exam covered material from test 3 and beyond. The textbook that was used in this course was *An introduction to Thermal Physics* by Daniel Schroeder.

## Course review

The course was well taught and the material was well delivered. Joanna really made an attempt to ensure students understood the material. For the course material itself, it was time consuming and one of the harder courses I have taken at UBC. Being a four credit course, that's to be expected. Overall, I would say this class has taught me a lot about thermodynamics and has given me more insight as to how important statistics really is.
